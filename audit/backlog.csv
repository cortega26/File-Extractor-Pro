ID,Severity(S0-S3),Area,Component/Page,Steps to Reproduce,Expected,Actual,Root Cause,Fix,Owner,Effort
Q-101,S1,CLI,Headless extraction,"Run `python -m services.cli <folder>` without specifying --extensions.","CLI processes the folder using a sensible default extension set and reports processed files.","Extraction exits successfully but reports zero files processed and writes no output.","Inclusion mode paired with an empty extensions tuple filters every file by default.","Treat empty extensions as wildcard/all or default to COMMON_EXTENSIONS in CLI parsing.",Backend Lead,≤2h
Q-102,S1,UX/Feedback,Progress bar,"Start a GUI extraction against a folder containing multiple eligible files.","Progress bar increments gradually up to 100% as files complete.","Progress jumps to 100% after the first file and stays pegged because `total_files` grows with each processed file.","Processor computes the denominator lazily instead of pre-counting/estimating workload.","Provide an upfront file count (dry run or heuristic) and emit progress with a stable total; fall back to indeterminate mode when unknown.",Front-end Lead,1-2d
Q-103,S1,Maintainability,Desktop GUI,"Review `ui.py` responsibilities and attempt to add a new widget or theme.","UI responsibilities split across smaller view/controller modules with clear seams.","Single `ui.py` module spans ~1k lines handling layout, state, theming, and service orchestration.","Lack of componentisation and presenter layer keeps all concerns inside `FileExtractorGUI`.","Extract layout builders, theme manager, and service adapter into dedicated modules; introduce presenter/view separation with tests.",Front-end Lead,1-2w
Q-104,S1,Tooling,Static analysis,"Run `mypy --strict .` from the repository root.","Type checking passes as part of CI gate.","Command fails with 62 errors across services, UI, and tests.","Legacy modules never annotated and tests rely on unchecked dynamic Tk APIs.","Add type hints, stub Tk interfaces, and configure mypy (with per-module strictness) so CI can enforce typing.",Tech Lead,1-2w
Q-105,S2,Performance,File processing,"Process a folder containing a 150MB UTF-8 text file.","Large files stream to output without hard failure, subject to available disk space.","Processor raises MemoryError and logs an error, skipping the file entirely.","Hard-coded 100MB guard remains from earlier buffering implementation.","Replace static cap with configurable threshold or streaming guard tied to available memory; document behaviour.",Backend Lead,≤2h
Q-106,S2,Concurrency,Status queue,"Stress extraction that emits >256 log/status messages.","All terminal state updates (success/error) reach the UI/CLI reliably.","`_enqueue_message` drops whichever message was dequeued to free space, risking loss of the final state payload.","Backpressure strategy evicts arbitrary items instead of prioritising state transitions.","Adopt ring-buffer semantics or dedicated channel for state events; drain batches before enqueueing new info.",Backend Lead,1-2d
Q-107,S2,Accessibility,Keyboard navigation,"Navigate the GUI using keyboard only (Tab/Shift+Tab).","Key actions expose mnemonics or shortcuts and focus order groups related controls.","No accelerators or contextual instructions; focus order follows widget creation with long tab chains.","Accessibility support stops at default Tk focus handling with no shortcut strategy.","Introduce Alt-based mnemonics, document keyboard shortcuts in UI, and group controls with logical focus management.",Front-end Lead,1-2d
Q-108,S2,Observability,Run analytics,"Inspect logs/metrics after a long extraction run.","Structured telemetry reports duration, throughput, and queue saturation.","Only textual log lines exist; no timings or counters for performance analysis.","Extraction pipeline lacks instrumentation hooks.","Record per-run summary metrics (elapsed time, files/sec, queue depth) and surface via logs/CLI output.",Tech Lead,1-2d
Q-109,S3,Documentation,README,"Review CLI usage instructions in README.","Docs explain that --extensions is mandatory or defaults to a documented profile.","README omits CLI guidance, leading to silent zero-output runs.","Documentation never updated after CLI addition.","Add CLI section covering default behaviours, required flags, and examples.",Product Owner,≤2h
Q-110,S3,Testing,CI pipeline,"Inspect repository tooling for coverage reporting.","Coverage thresholds enforced in CI to guard regressions.","pytest runs locally but no coverage configuration or reporting exists.","Coverage tooling not wired into test suite or CI.","Adopt coverage.py/pytest-cov with thresholds aligned to R3 targets and publish reports in CI.",QA Lead,≤2h
