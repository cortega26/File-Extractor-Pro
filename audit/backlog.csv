ID,Severity(S0-S3),Area,Component/Page,Steps to Reproduce,Expected,Actual,Root Cause,Fix,Owner,Effort
Q-001,S0,Testing,End-to-end extraction,Run any regression without manual QA,Automated suite fails on regression,No automated coverage so regressions ship,No tests or harness exist,Stand up pytest suite covering extraction + queue interactions,QA Lead,1-2w
Q-002,S1,Architecture,Application core,Review module layout,Extraction logic isolated from GUI for reuse,Single monolithic module mixes UI/config/I-O,Tight coupling of responsibilities,Extract processor/config/UI into separate modules with interfaces,Tech Lead,1-2w
Q-003,S1,Performance/Concurrency,Extraction thread,Start extraction then cancel mid-run,Cancellation completes without crash or hang,Asyncio loop in worker thread may hang during cancel,Improper asyncio integration with Tkinter,Replace with managed asyncio runner or synchronous worker + queue,Backend Lead,1-2w
Q-004,S1,UX/UI,Main window,Launch app on 13" laptop or 150% zoom,Window resizes gracefully and maintains layout,Window locked at 700x700 with clipped controls,Hard-coded geometry/minsize,Allow responsive resizing and adjust grid weights,Front-end Lead,1-2d
Q-005,S1,Performance,File traversal,Extract folder with 10k files,Runtime scales linearly with one traversal,Two full os.walk passes double disk I/O,Duplicate counting then processing loops,Streamline into single traversal with running totals,Backend Lead,1-2d
Q-006,S2,Maintainability,Configuration,Edit config.ini with invalid mode,App validates and guides user,Invalid values silently accepted causing runtime issues,No schema validation for config,Introduce typed config schema + validation,Tech Lead,1-2d
Q-007,S2,Performance,File reading,Process 80MB text file,Memory stays within limits,Entire file buffered before write causing spikes,Chunk aggregation into memory,Stream chunks directly to writer,Backend Lead,≤2h
Q-008,S2,UX/Performance,Progress messaging,Process large tree quickly,Progress text updates smoothly,Queue floods causing lag and stale UI,Unbounded queue + 100ms polling,Drain queue more frequently or bound size with backpressure,Front-end Lead,≤2h
Q-009,S3,Maintainability,Logging,Import module within tests,Logging configurable per consumer,Import side-effects install rotating handler,Global logging setup at import time,Move logging config into entry point + allow injection,Tech Lead,≤2h
